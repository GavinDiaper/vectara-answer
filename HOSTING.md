## Hosting vectara-answer

This guide provides specific instructions to help you host your `vectara-answer` application on one of the popular hosting providers.

We keep adding new hosting providers regularly - please let us know if you need instructions for a hosting provider that is not yet included.

### Overview

To run a hosted version of `vectara-answer` you would need to have a configuration folder as specified in the [README](README.md), including:

* `config.yaml` which specifies the configuration parameters for your application
* `queries.json` which specifies the pre-defined set of queries
* `secrets.toml` which includes the profile used to access the API KEY

In some cases, additional files such as a log image might be included in the config folder, but at a minimum you would need the 3 files mentioned above.

In the following we will assume you have the configuration folder named `config` ready to go.
